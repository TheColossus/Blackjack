# Overview
Cheating in videogames is fun sometimes, and the same is true in real life. I want to learn how to count cards in Blackjack, but I don't really want to go to a casino or use an existing program. We're supposed to be learning C++ this year in school so this is a quick thing I whipped up for fun. Still in progress though.

 ## Missing Features
 - Currently you can't split your hand if you open with a pair
 - You can't play more than 1 round, the skeleton is there but it's buggy

I'll come back to this later, right now I'm working on another project.
